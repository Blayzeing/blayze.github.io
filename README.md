###  Background

I am a PhD Student studying under the supervision of [Dr. Michael Mangan](https://michaelmangan.github.io/) as part of the [ManganLab Biorobotics Research Group](https://manganlab.github.io/), in collaboration with the [Brains On Board project](http://brainsonboard.co.uk/).

I am currently studying the information content that can be retrieved by insect eyes and developing technologies to do so, my project can be found [here](https://github.com/ManganLab/insect-eye-simulator).

###  Biography

In 2018 I received my bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science (with a year in industry) from the University of Sheffield, and subsequently continued on to my current position as a PhD candidate.

In the past I have worked in the data analysis and defence sectors, predominantly working with and creating machine learning and AI systems.
